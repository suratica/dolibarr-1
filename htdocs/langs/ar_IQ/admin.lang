Enter as many zeros as the desired length of the counter. The counter will be completed by zeros from the left in order to have as many zeros as the mask. <br><b>{000000+000}</b> same as the previous one but an offset corresponding to the number to the right of the + sign is applied starting on the first %s. <br><b>{000000@x}</b> same as the previous one but the counter is reset to zero when month x is reached (x between 1 and 12, or 0 to use the early months of fiscal year defined in your configuration, or 99 to reset to zero every month). If this option is used and x is 2 or higher, then the sequence {yy}{mm} or {yyyy}{mm} is also required. <br><b>{dd}</b> day (01 to 31).<br><b>{mm}</b> month (01 to 12).<br><b>{yy}</b>, <b>{yyyy}</b> or <b>{y}</b> year over 2, 4 or 1 numbers. <br>
